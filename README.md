# Cogworks.UmbracoFlare
This project aims to provide a basic level of service integration between Cloudflare and the open-source ASP.NET CMS Umbraco.

*This is a fork of the main UmbracoFlare project offered by The Scylla Group at https://github.com/scyllagroup/UmbracoFlare. Created by Cogworks(Ale) for freedom fridays. It contains a massive refactor and bug fixes to work with Umbraco 7.15.7, now the functionality works around the current domain. It is being offered to the community as-is.*

**_Happy to maintain the package, add new features and fix the reported bugs._**
